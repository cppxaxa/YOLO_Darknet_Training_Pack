# YOLO Darknet Training Toolkit Pack

AlexeyAB Darknet for compiling darknet: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Reference Tutorial: https://timebutt.github.io/static/how-to-train-yolov2-to-detect-custom-objects/

Note: The compiled darknet may not run in your windows pc. My version of darknet is compiled with NVIDIA CUDA9.0 and OpenCV3.0
If you are not able to run the toolkit, please get darknet compiled first and replace my binaries. 

I have just added a converter utility to convert the format of VoTT YOLO to AlexeyAB darknet so that it can be used in windows.

All the steps are just scripted in *.cmd files to easily launch the apps.
